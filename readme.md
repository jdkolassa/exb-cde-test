# ArcGIS Experience Builder Test

## Purpose

This project is solely to test if it is possible to put a copy of the ArcGIS Experience Builder from Esri in a Stackblitz, CodeSandbox, or other CDE environment. The purpose of this is to explore possibilities for improved collaboration, demonstrating technical problems to fellow developers, and if this will have any impact on developer productivity.

[ArcGIS Experience Builder](https://developers.arcgis.com/experience-builder/) is a product of Esri, I just develop apps with it. 

## Running List of Issues

### Stackblitz

- [ ] Project lacks a `package.json` at the top level, which Stackblitz needs. However, ExB doesn't really work that way.
